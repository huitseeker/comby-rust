# comby-rust

Rewrite rules for [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) code using the
[comby](https://comby.dev/) refactoring tool.

## Overview

This structural find-and-replace tool allows implementing rules with different
purposes:

- `templates.toml`:
  refactorings that are non-controversial and will require minimal manual supervision a posteriori. They should not change code semantics.
- `experimental-templates.toml`:
  refactorings that are a matter of style, or will require modifications in a large number of cases, but may still be useful.
- `nopanic.toml`:
  refactorings that remove panics (and therefore change semantics).

## Requirements and installation

  Please refer to the [comby installation and usage instructions](https://comby.dev/docs/get-started).

## Running

- `comby -config templates.toml -f .rs` finds matches
- `comby -config templates.toml -f .rs -i` replaces file contents
- **You may want to run `cargo clean` before running the above**
- **You should run `cargo fmt` after running the above**

Exclude `target` directory with:

- `comby -config template.toml -f .rs -i -exclude-dir target`

## Testing

See the `test/run.sh` script for templates and expected results.

repo for the Go language, which inspired this.
